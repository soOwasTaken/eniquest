# Old web vs New web.


* First step :
  * Creating 2 app in vue, for both website part :
    * ## One for the old website that will have those points :
      - A old 2000's websearch design.
      - some forums, people talking about stuff...
      - being able to return, and go somewhere else on the page.
      - some blog or content.
      - 5 or 6 links on page.
      * a website that can has a prompt where you can add passwords that will be hidden in both web part.
    * ## One for the new web.
      * More modern ui, using bootstrap or something.
      * More publicy and ads.
      * has to pay to watch full content on a website like Medium etc, obviously don't use real name.
      * sponsorised link above all the contents for people that pay to be shown before others.
      * 5 - 6 fake pages too.
